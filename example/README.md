# Wire Render Pattern Example
This is a simple example for organizing the files. It takes a sightly different configuration as `global/header.php` and `globals/footer.php` were put in a single file called `views/default.php`. Also `views/home_view.php` was renamed to `views/home.php`. Processwire 3.x namespaces were added as well.

A file named `bootstrap.sh` was used for creating the directory structure quickly.
